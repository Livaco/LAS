**NOTE: LAS is in alpha and should not be considered as a daily driver admin system yet.**

# Livaco's Admin System (LAS)
Livaco's Admin System (LAS), is a lightweight admin system i've been working on. It's no where near done, but i've decided to release it as an alpha. Feel free to contribute if you really wish to.

## Installation
Just download and drag LAS into your Garry's Mod addons folder. Next, start up your server. LAS should set itself up. Once your done, join your server and run the console command:
`las setgroup <YOUR STEAM NAME> superadmin`
This will set your usergroup to superadmin to allow you to run commands.
